With the advent of technology usable in everyday life, it has gotten even more complex.  We are able to do almost everything on the move through smart phones and the other gadgets.  Technology is built around human-beings to help them to get smarter.  Choice is one of the edges that technology provides.  We literally get a plethora of choices to make.\n\nFundamentally man is a choice maker and he doesn’t want to make wrong choices.  On several circumstances we are overwhelmed with the options in front of us, we are constantly browsing them all the time to grab the best one.  While this may not be bad for most important things in life, the fact is that we are in constant mode of search for everything and at times we don’t even have a reason to search.  Eventually we become prey to the industry which thrives on impulsive decision making.\n\nOn the other hand, there is over dosage of media coverage that is zapping our attention on different directions which may or may not be of any value to us personally.  News and entertainment has become a habit for many of us.  Instead of it serving a purpose to contribute in our personal growth, we are becoming consumers of news and entertainment with a burden of accumulating unwanted knowledge.\n\nMulti-tasking is another buzz that is draining our energy.  With all the technological penetration and the intent to get the maximum from everything, we are constantly engaged in multiple things at the same time.

At any moment, we are almost appearing as if we are steering a spacecraft with countless gadgets around us to navigate to the space.\n\nI believe it is time for us to pause and take a moment to validate what’s going on.  There are so many distractions around us through which our attention is getting dissipated.  It is nothing much different from keeping our eyes open and day dreaming.  We would probably be better off with day dreaming instead of being active on multiple gadgets.  We take pride in claiming that we are very busy.  The question that we should ask ourselves is, are we productive?  Let us think about it.\n\nLife is nothing but the duration between birth and death and whatever we do in this period is called living.   The clock starts ticking from the time we are born until the last breath.  Living is not just about being alive; it is about being able to live life to the fullest.

I might just say that I have achieved very little success so far, as time and again, it pops out with the same power of a shaken soda bottle!  Over time, I have also realised why it has been so difficult to crack this nut.  One main reason why I find it difficult in conquering this demon is that it is something created by me.  Hence, I keep trying to not let it go, because it has become so absorbed in me.  A creator always finds it difficult to let go of his own creation, isn’t it?\n\nAfter a tired day, when sleep takes over, I naturally give in to it and get into a deep slumber.  I really do not try to fight against it and the progression is natural and smooth.

I tried to use this analogy and inferred that whenever and wherever there is resistance, my close friend ‘Mr. Ego’ spontaneously gives me the best company!  Where there is ‘giving in’, he finds my company not worthwhile.\n\nHaving understood that this was my own creation, the next steps that I took was to see what were those key ingredients that helped me in creating this fellow.  For, if I tried to eliminate those one by one, I firmly believed that I can be a better person, if not a person with ego fully eliminated.  I made up my mind to pluck the first low hanging fruit and crack it.  I engaged systematically in a ‘Five-Why’ type of analysis, the brain child of the Japanese, who used this method in their pursuit for high-quality standards and perfection.

I got to grip with a small component that, if conquered, could probably put my dear friend Mr. Ego’s head down a little bit, if not bring him down on his knees.  A self-promotion tactic, nowadays referred to as ‘humble bragging’, is what my analytics lead me to.  This is a critical ego booster.

But as days passed by, I realized it wasn’t as easy as I thought out to be.  Almost everywhere we find examples of this gap, this mismatch – between what we want to do and what we end up doing.  We invariably do what’s easy than what’s right.\n\nMany diabetic patients know that eating sweets and not taking care of health would lead to severe complications.  But there are such patients who yield to their temptations.\n\nProper maintenance of accounts will help in smooth functioning of the business and will make auditing easy.

Postponing and avoiding what is right and going on indulging in what’s wrong is probably one of the biggest human weaknesses which almost all of us have.

It’s true that any kind of enterprise we want to engage in requires some kind of financial wealth if it wants to succeed in the short term.

Material capital sits on the top layer, social capital lies in the middle, and spiritual capital rests on the bottom, supporting all three (see “Three Forms of Capital”).\n\nAccording to political economist Francis Fukuyama, who wrote Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity (Free Press, 1995), social capital can be measured by the amount of trust in a society, empathy people feel for each other, and commitment to the health of the community.

Differences of opinion can distance us from others.\r\n\r\nSo how do we handle differences of opinion?

We have to accept it as a living reality and deal with it on a daily basis.  As many people there are in this world, so many opinions there will be.

Initially, I felt very mechanical to go through the training, as I was required to type same set of keystrokes on sheets of papers for practicing.

The more we learn about it, the more endearing it becomes.\n\nThe brain can differentiate colours, it can differentiate patterns, it can even differentiate one person from the next – simply by seeing them.  Adding to that is its ability to control other senses.  We even eat with our eyes!  For instance, the reason coloured candy is a runaway success is the ability of the human mind to perceive each colour differently.  It may sound odd, but the truth remains that people are more likely to eat a bag full of coloured candy.  However, they would stop after a few pieces if the bowl is filled with the same colour.  This is because of our ability to see variety.  As a result the mind believes that the pink coloured piece and the blue one taste differently, even though they are made exactly the same way.\n\nThe value we associate with the ability to see is extremely high.  The impact it has on our lives is even higher; but what is it worth to us?  Everything the human mind can do, people are now developing machinery to do the same.
